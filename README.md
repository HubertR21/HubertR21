#  Hello there 👋
I’m @HubertR21, also known as Hubert Ruczyński
- 👨🏻‍🎓 I've got my Bachelor Degree in Data Science at Faculty of Mathematics and Information Science, Warsaw University of Technology in 2023,
- 👨🏻‍🎓 I’m currently pursuing Master's Degree in Data Science at Faculty of Mathematics and Information Science, Warsaw University of Technology, and I'll graduate by the enf of June 2024,
- 👀 I’m interested in AutoML, Natural Language Processing (NLP), Data Visualization, Machine Learning Algorithms, fairness, and eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI),
- 📓 My main points of interest are AutoML, and NLP,
- 🔎 For two and a half years I've been working scientifically as a researcher at MI^2 DataLab and participated in 3 major studies / projects (fairPAN, forester, ATLAS),
- 🔎 Currently I'm still pursuiing the possible research and development topics connected to forester,
- 🔎 During the summer 2023, I've got a grant from CyberSummer@WUT-3 initiative for studies, and improvements of forester package,
- 📊 I've been teaching Data Visualization Techinques (DVT), and Exploratory Data Analysis at Faculty of Mathematics and Information Science for last 2 years,
- 📦 I'm an R enthusiast and I love developing R packages (browse fairPAN and forester below),
- 👓 I also enjoy spreading the knowledge, so I've participated in 8 Machine Learning Conferences (WhyR? Conf, Coseal x 2, MLinPL x 3, Ghost Day, AutoML'23),
- 📑 In 2023 the paper about forester package, titled 'forester: A Novel Approach to Accessible and Interpretable AutoML for Tree-Based Modeling' got accepted at AutoML'2023 Conference: https://openreview.net/pdf?id=Q3DWpGoX7PD,
- 📑 Currently, the NLP related, ATLAS project paper titled: 'Big Tech influence over AI research revisited: memetic analysis of attribution of ideas to affiliation' is under review to Journal of Informetrics,
- 📑 Another 2 papers regarding the forester project are in progress,
- 📫 You can reach me via my email address hruczynski21@interia.pl, or LinkedIn profile https://www.linkedin.com/in/hubertr21/,
- ✔️ You can browse all the projects, presentations, papers, certificates, etc on [this repository](https://github.com/HubertR21/Hubert-Ruczynski-Projects).
