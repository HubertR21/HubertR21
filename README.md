#  Hello there 👋
I’m @HubertR21, also known as Hubert Ruczyński
- 👨🏻‍🎓 I'm working as a Specialist of Credit Risk Model Validator at VeloBank, 
- 👨🏻‍🎓 I've got my Bachelor Degree in Data Science at Faculty of Mathematics and Information Science, Warsaw University of Technology in 2023,
- 👨🏻‍🎓 I've got my Master's Degree in Data Science at Faculty of Mathematics and Information Science, Warsaw University of Technology in 2024,
- 👀 I’m interested in AutoML, Data Visualization, Credit Risk, Natural Language Processing (NLP), Machine Learning Algorithms, fairness, and eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI),
- 📓 My main points of interest are AutoML, and Credit Risk,
- 🔎 For two and a half years I've been working scientifically as a researcher at MI^2 DataLab and participated in 3 major studies / projects (fairPAN, forester, ATLAS),
- 🔎 During the summer 2023, I've got a grant from CyberSummer@WUT-3 initiative for studies, and improvements of forester package,
- 🔎 In 2024 I've finilized my research regarding the data preprocessing for tree-based models and published the results of this study.
- 📊 I've been teaching Data Visualization Techinques (DVT), and Exploratory Data Analysis at Faculty of Mathematics and Information Science for 3 years,
- 📦 I'm an R enthusiast and I love developing R packages, both Open Source (browse fairPAN and forester below), and commerical (at VeloBank: AutoLGD, AutoNMD, AutoPDLT),
- 👓 I also enjoy spreading the knowledge, so I've participated in 9 Machine Learning Conferences (WhyR? Conf, Coseal x 2, MLinPL x 3, Ghost Day, AutoML'23, AutoML'24),
- 📑 In 2023 the paper about forester package, titled 'forester: A Novel Approach to Accessible and Interpretable AutoML for Tree-Based Modeling' got accepted at [AutoML'2023 Conference](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=Q3DWpGoX7PD),
- 📑 In 2024 the paper titled: 'Big Tech influence over AI research revisited: memetic analysis of attribution of ideas to affiliation' has been pulished in [Journal of Informetrics](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1751157724000841),
- 📑 In 2024 the paper titled: 'Do Tree-based Models Need Data Preprocessing?' has been published at [AutoML'2023 Conference](https://openreview.net/forum?id=08Y5sFtRhN)),
- 📑 Another paper regarding the forester project is in progress,
- 📫 You can reach me via my email address hruczynski21@interia.pl, or [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hubertr21/),
- ✔️ You can browse all the projects, presentations, papers, certificates, etc on [this repository](https://github.com/HubertR21/Hubert-Ruczynski-Projects).
