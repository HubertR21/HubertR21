#  Hello there 👋
I’m @HubertR21, also known as Hubert Ruczyński
- 👨🏻‍🎓 I've got my Bachelor Degree in Data Science at Faculty of Mathematics and Information Science, Warsaw University of Technology in 2023,
- 👨🏻‍🎓 I’m currently pursuing Master's Degree in Data Science at Faculty of Mathematics and Information Science, Warsaw University of Technology,
- 👀 I’m interested in AutoML, Natural Language Processing (NLP), Data Visualization, Machine Learning Algorithms, fairness, and eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI),
- 📓 My main points of interest are AutoML, and NLP,
- 🌱 I've learnt a lot about mathematical, and statistical background of ML model recently, and I understand the importance of that knowledge,
- 🔎 For two years I've been working scientifically as a researcher at MI^2 DataLab and participated in 3 major studies / projects,
- 📊 I've been teaching Data Visualization Techinques (DVT), and Exploratory Data Analysis at Faculty of Mathematics and Information Science,
- 📦 I'm an R enthusiast and I love developing R packages (browse fairpan and forester below),
- 👓 I also enjoy spreading the knowledge, so I've participated in 5 Data Science Conferences (WhyR? Conf, Coseal, MLinPL x 2, Ghost Day),
- 📑 Additionally, in 2023 the paper about forester package got accepted at AutoML'2023 Conference: https://openreview.net/pdf?id=Q3DWpGoX7PD,
